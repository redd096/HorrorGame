      - in SetNodeDataValues save UserData (the value you created at point 1.a.)
      - (optional) in CreateSaveFolder create folder with the string you create before
      - in SetValuesAndSaveFile create a LevelNodeData (point 1.b.) from the UserData we saved before
      - in SetNodeValues load UserData from the LevelNodeData

4. go to Scripts/Managers
