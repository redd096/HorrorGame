When you create a new level, you have to check these managers:

- LevelManager is the manager that starts and manage the day and has the list of every LevelNode (customers, events, etc...)
It has also:
	- LevelEventsManager to manage specific events (probably this doesn't need changes)
	- CheckPlayerChoiceManager to manage when player lets enter customers or not. It has also the rules for the level
	- ResidentsManager used by CheckPlayerChoice to know which customer is a resident
	- AppointmentsManager used by CheckPlayerChoice to know which appointment is scheduled for this level


These are the managers for the player and interactables in scene:

- DeskManager manage what happens on the desk, both left and right screen
It has also:
	- DeskStateMachine to know when can call different functions. This inherit IInteractablesEvents and is called by every interactable when an input occurs
	- DeskWindowsManager to manage the windows on the right (give back documents, put back interactables, the board to put documents and the book)



Other managers:

- DialogueManager, manage the dialogues
- LevelUtilities, manage simple functions like move customers or play dialogues
